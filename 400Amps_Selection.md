Based on my web search, it seems that most outdoor electric breaker panel boxes for apartments have only one 200 amp main breaker. However, I found some products that may suit your needs:

- [Eaton Type CH 400-Amp 8-Spaces 16-Circuit Outdoor Main Breaker Meter Combo Load Center], which has two 200 amp main breakers and 16 circuits in 8 spaces.
- [Siemens MC0816B1400RLTM 400 Amp 8 Space 16 Circuit Levery Bypass Meter-Load Center Combination Main Breaker with Feed Thru Lugs and Ringless Cover], which has two 200 amp main breakers and 16 circuits in 8 spaces.
- [Square D by Schneider Electric SC3042M225PF Homeline 225-Amp 30-Space 42-Circuit Outdoor Surface Mount Solar-Ready Combination Meter Socket and Main Breaker Load Center], which has two 200 amp main breakers and 42 circuits in 30 spaces.

You can find more details about these products by clicking on the links above or visiting the websites of the manufacturers. I hope this helps you find what you are looking for. ðŸ˜Š
